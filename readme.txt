instructions: 

If you just want to execute the code, go to /IA-Projeto_RNA_AG/store/ and run "java -jar IA-Projeto_RNA_AG.jar"
wait some seconds if nothing shows on the graph, the process can take about ~90 seconds at max

If you want to make changes to it, install Netbeans and open as a project. To compile into a Jar with all the libs included, you will need to right-click "build.xml", select "executar destino" or "run target", then "outros destinos" or "other targets", then "package-for-store". The .jar will then be created in the "store" folder.
